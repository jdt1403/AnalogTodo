# Today
A minimalist task manager designed to focus on *today*'s top priorities. 

*For iOS 16+*

Heavily inspired by UgMonk's [Analog](https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog) physical card productivity system (check it out!). 

I started this project to get some practice with SwiftUI and challenge myself to make an app I would want to use daily. 



## The App
**simple by design**

This is not a long-term to-do list app, it's a tool to help focus and prioritize *today*.

**freedom by limitation**

You are only concerned with *today*'s tasks, and you are limited to ten tasks each day. *Today* encourages you to re-prioritize your list each day, so you are always focused on the few tasks that really move the needle.

**the tool is not the task**

This tool evolved from my paper-and-pen system, based on how my brain works. 
I aimed to replicate the handful of symbols I found myself using (again, riffing on the [Analog](https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog) system) to track where I was at with each given task (see below). 
It's meant to get out of the way and let you *do* your to-do's.

^Task status symbols and their descriptions. All custom SwiftUI shapes!
